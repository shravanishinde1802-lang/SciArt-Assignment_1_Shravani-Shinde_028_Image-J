ImageJ Particle Counting Protocol
Assignment 1 – Image Analysis

Step 0: Image Acquisition
I first downloaded a raw fluorescence microscopy image from an online database (OpenCell/ImageJ sample datasets). I made sure that the particles in the image were clearly distinguishable from the background and that the image was not pre-processed.

The original image was saved in the data/raw/ folder without modification. I also recorded the metadata of the image, including source, magnification, pixel size (if available), and staining/channel information, in a separate metadata file.

Step 1: Opening and Pre-processing the Image
I opened the image in ImageJ using: File → Open

To standardize the format, I converted the image to 8-bit grayscale: Image → Type → 8-bit

Next, I removed background noise using the subtract background function: Process → Subtract Background

Rolling Ball Radius used: 12 pixels
Light background option: Not selected
This step helped in reducing uneven illumination and improving particle visibility.

After that, I adjusted the brightness and contrast: Image → Adjust → Brightness/Contrast

I first applied Auto, and then manually fine-tuned the levels to make the particles more clearly visible without overexposing the image.

Step 2: Thresholding
To separate particles from the background, I applied thresholding: Image → Adjust → Threshold

Method used: Default
Lower threshold value: 217
Upper threshold value: 255
Display mode: Black & White
I adjusted the threshold sliders until the particles appeared clearly highlighted while minimizing background noise.

After achieving a satisfactory selection, I applied the threshold to convert the image into a binary format.

Since some particles were touching or clustered, I applied watershed segmentation: Process → Binary → Watershed

This helped in separating overlapping particles by introducing 1 pixel boundaries between them.

Step 3: Setting Measurements
Since the image did not contain a scale bar, I performed all measurements in pixel units.

I then selected the parameters required for analysis: Analyze → Set Measurements

The following measurements were selected:

Area
Perimeter
Feret’s Diameter
Shape Descriptors
Mean Gray Value
Step 4: Particle Analysis
I performed particle analysis using: Analyze → Analyze Particles

The parameters used were:

Size range: 50 – Infinity pixels²
Circularity: 0.4 – 1.0
These values were chosen to exclude very small noise particles and focus on roughly circular objects.

The following options were enabled:

Display Results
Summarize
Exclude on Edges
Add to Manager
Overlay
After running the analysis, a results table was generated along with an overlay showing detected particles.

Step 5: Saving and Exporting Results
The results table was saved as a CSV file: Results → File → Save As

Saved in: results/stats/particle_count_results.csv

Next, I flattened the overlay to permanently embed the particle outlines on the image: Image → Overlay → Flatten

The processed image was then saved as a TIFF file: File → Save As → TIFF

Saved in: data/processed/particle_analysis_annotated.tif

Since no scale calibration was performed, no scale bar was added to the final image.

Final Outcome
At the end of the analysis, I obtained:

A CSV file containing quantitative measurements of all detected particles
An annotated image with clearly marked particle boundaries
This protocol ensures reproducible particle detection and analysis in ImageJ, with parameter selection tailored to the specific image.
